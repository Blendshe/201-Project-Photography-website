#201 Project: a photography website 

For the 201 project i will be creating a photography website with a number of features.  Some of these ideas for what the photography website needs to do are from the class where we learned about User Stories and we used my idea of a photography website as our example for that particular lesson.  

Unfortunately the Trello Board we used was archived so I can't refer back to exactly what we agreed were priorities, however,

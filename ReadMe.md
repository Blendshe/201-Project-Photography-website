# 201 Project: a photography website 

For the 201 project I will be creating a photography website with a number of features.  Some of these ideas for what the photography website needs to do are from the class where we learned about User Stories and we used my idea of a photography website as our example for that particular lesson.  

Unfortunately the Trello Board we used was archived so I can't refer back to exactly what we agreed were priorities, however, I remember the top 2 of the class and I will also add in the priorities I have as a photographer as this work is building towards a website that I will continue to work on once this project has completed, and will eventually launch as a live website.  This is something I have wanted to do for a long time. 

## User Story  

The user will want to be able to see the photographs so wthere will need to a way of displaying them so there will be a gallery.  The user will want to be able to search the photographs to be able to target the types they are interested in somehow.  Once the User has viewed the photographs they will look at how the phtographs can be produced.  The photographs will not be downloadable as the formats would compress the image file reducing the detail and colour information.  Instead the User will wantto be able to commission a third-party to produce the photographs, and be able to choose exactly what medium this will be.  There will need to be a link to a third-party who can produce the photograph in different formats, for example metal, acrylic, canvas and then send them to the User.      

The User will be interested to know what the photographer will be doing in the future so would like to be able to subscribe to a newsletter on the website itself.  The User may also want to contact the photographer to commission a particular photograph so will need a way of contacting them. 

## Below is a list of the features I belive a User will want a 3 page photography website to have: 

1. Gallery (flexbox, image tag, Alt text): Page1   
2. List of genres (unordered list)  
3. Search bar (button, event listener, event handler): Page1  
4. Feature buttons (these render the photographs of the particular genre requested by the User): Page1  
5. Contact form (form, possibly rendered on the UI with a button requirung input to confirm details): Page3  
6. Choose frames (external YouTube link, alt text):Page2  
7. Logo (image in header, alt text): Page1  
8. subscribe (button, input, not rendered on the UI): unsure which page yet, will explore as part of the Wireframe process  

## Concepts used:

a. Input button
b. Event listener and handler
c. List
d. Form
e. Getter - search button
f. Array
g. Flexbox
h. Images 
i. Hyperlink to videos - external links on YouTube
j. Form
m. getElementByid
n. CSS styling

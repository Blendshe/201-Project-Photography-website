# 201 Project: a photography website 

For the 201 project I will be creating a photography website with a number of features.  Some of these ideas for what the photography website needs to do are from the class where we learned about User Stories and we used my idea of a photography website as our example for that particular lesson.  

Unfortunately the Trello Board we used was archived so I can't refer back to exactly what we agreed were priorities, however, I remember the top 2 of the class and I will also add in the priorities I have as a photographer as this work is building towards a website that I will continue to work on once this project has completed, and will eventually launch as a live website.  This is something I have wanted to do for a long time.  

Below is a list of the features I want a 3 page photography website to have: 

1. Gallery (flexbox, image tag, Alt text): Page1   
2. List of genres (unordered list)  
3. Search bar (button, event listener, event handler): Page1  
4. Feature buttons (these render the photographs of the particular genre requested by the User): Page1  
5. Contact form (form, possibly rendered on the UI with a button requirung input to confirm details): Page3  
6. Choose frames (external YouTube link, alt text):Page2  
7. Logo (image in header, alt text): Page1  
8. subscribe (button, input, not rendered on the UI): unsure which page yet, will explore as part of the Wireframe process  

Concepts used:

a. Input button
b. Event listener and handler
c. List
d. Form
e. Getter - search button
f. Array
g. Flexbox
h. Images 
i. Hyperlink to videos - external links on YouTube
j. Form
m. getElementByid
n. CSS styling
